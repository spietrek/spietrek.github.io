![VS Code](../images/vscode.png "VS Code")

Over my career, I have been a developer IDE/Editor snob. I am always looking for the latest and greatest tools to use.

I started my development career using [Borland Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi). When I started at my current [employer](https://www.cardinalsolutions.com/), I was a SharePoint developer, so I used [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com). Visual Studio was nice; however, I fell in love with [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) as it did a great job pointing out mistakes in my code. Both IDE's were nice; however, there was not much configuration and personalization availble. They also had many features that I never used.

During the past 5 years, I have transitioned to more of a front end developer which has opened the opportunities to use alternative development environments. Unlike huge IDE's like Visual Studio, these light-weight editors provided great performance and allowed me to focus on the features I needed. If a feature was unavailable, extensions could be added to provide the additional functionality.

Although closer to an IDE, I started off using [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and really enjoyed it until a new version came out which caused some DPI scaling issues with my Surface Pro. They quickly released a fix; however, I was already looking for alternatives. I quickly found [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) which I enjoyed using for a period of time. What I loved about Brackets was the ability to add extensions to the editor. Beautify, Autoprefixer, Minifier, Brackets Gits, Emmet, and Live Reload opened my eyes to using extensions to provide a great developer UX and provide personalization. [Atom](https://atom.io/) was soon released and I made another editor move. Atom's extension ecosystem was huge and I found many extensions and themes to use. There was also an increase in editor plugins focused on a specific technology (e.g. React and React Native).

# VS Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an open-source source code editor written by Microsoft and released in April 2015. Over the course of almost 3 years, VS Code has become one of the most used editors. In the 2017 [State of JavaScript survey](https://stateofjs.com/2017/other-tools/), VS Code has the highest number of users. At this point (December 2017), VS Code has close to 500 contributors on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode). The contributors do a great job of releasing new functionality every month. On feature I am definitely looking forward to having is [Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share). Live Share will enable developers to collaborate in real-time on the same codebase without the need to synchronize code or to configure the same development tools, settings, or environment. Wow!

# My Favorite Extensions and Themes

I have been using VS Code for over a year (an eternity for me). I use the Insider's Build which provides new functionality quicker; however, there may be an occassional glitch. Below is a list of extensions, plugins, and themes I have installed.

# Summary

Regardless of which IDE or editor you use for development, there are plenty of great options available. Who knows, with how far online editors have come, (e.g. [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) and [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)), we may all be developing entirely online soon.

Hmm. A great feature to have would be for integration between your Editor and an online editor.
